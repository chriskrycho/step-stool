Type: page

This is a simple sample page to show how you might set the information in the
MultiMarkdown header: note the `Type: page` declaration, which will prevent
this document from being included in the blog posts list. Depending on your
template, the date may be ignored complete when this page is generated; in any
case it will not be used for sorting things at all.
