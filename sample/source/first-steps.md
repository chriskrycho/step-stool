I build Step Stool using [README-driven development][rdd], a concept I first
heard of late last year. The first thing I did was put together the basic
README. (Truth be told, I still need to finish it, as of the time I'm writing.
But I got distracted by needing to get my fingers dirty in a little code. I'll
get back to it in a day or two.)

As I was getting the README close to done, I started in on a website, because I
get excited about that sort of thing. (The truth is, I needed to flex my web
design chops just a bit, lest they get rusty and because I *really* have fun
doing it.) Around the same time, I started fleshing out some of the details of
how the back end was going to work: the required metadata on posts (which pushed
me to using the Multi-Markdown extensions of Markdown so I can *have* metadata
on posts), the required fields in the configuration file, and the templating
language.

That, actually, is what brought me this far. I needed to have some content
available to play with so that I could start validating the results as I
actually get around to implementing things over the next couple weeks. This,
then, is the first post in the history of Step Stool, as well as the first piece
of content written to test the functionality of Step Stool.

As such, you can think of this piece as an element in my test setup. ([Test-
driven development][tdd] is *also* good. This just wasn't the project in which I
wanted to try it out.) But I had no desire to create dummy content; anything I
do for this project I'd like to be of at least minimal public value. At some
point, I'll probably scan and upload the project brainstorming documents, just
for my own archival purposes and in case they're of interest to anyone else --
though of course the likelihood of that is surpassingly low.
